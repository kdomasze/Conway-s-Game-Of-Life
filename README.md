# Conway's Game Of Life

A implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C++ and SFML.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

The project was created using Visual Studio 2017 Version 15.3.4 using SFML 2.4.2. A build of SFML for visual studio 2017 is available [here](https://nightlybuilds.ch/project/show/1/SFML/).

In addition, the project makes use of [Visual Leak Detector](https://github.com/KindDragon/vld) for memory leak checking. Default install location is "C:/Program Files (x86)".

All that is required of the user before the project will compile is to place the requisite files from SFML into the SFML folder in the project. More information for setting this up is available in the [setup.md](SFML/setup.md) file.
